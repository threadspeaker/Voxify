# Voxify
Make 3D voxel models from 2D images. This is done by providing a sprite sheet. Each sprite in the sheet is treated as a "slice" or layer of the voxel model and the whole thing is built up layer by layer.

This was written with Python v3.13.2

# How to run
pip install -r requirements.txt
source voxify\Scripts\activate
py example.py
